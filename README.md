Blink Runner is a retro-style arcade runner where your character moves automatically and jumps based on sound input from your microphone. Players control the jumps and double jumps by generating noise (clapping, shouting, or using musical instruments). The game combines a neon 8-bit aesthetic with a fun and dynamic sound-reactive mechanic.
